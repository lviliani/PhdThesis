In this chapter, the first measurement of the 125\GeV Higgs boson cross section times branching ratio to a W boson pair at 13\TeV is presented. The analysis makes use of a total integrated luminosity of 2.3\ifb, collected during the 2015 proton-proton data taking period of the LHC. The analysis strategy follows the one described in Chapter~\ref{chap4}, with some differences described in the following.

With respect to the centre-of-mass energy of 8\TeV, the ggH production cross section at 13\TeV is expected to increase of a factor of 2, thus raising the number of expected signal events. Nevertheless, the cross section of the background processes increases as well: in particular, the WW production cross section of a factor of 1.8 and the \ttbar cross section of a factor of 3.5.
