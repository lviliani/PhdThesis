In this chapter, the first search for the SM Higgs boson decaying to a W boson pair at 13\TeV is presented, using a total integrated luminosity of 2.3\ifb,
collected during the 2015 proton-proton data taking period of the LHC.

%Final states in which the two W bosons decay leptonically are studied.
%Therefore, events with a pair of oppositely-charged leptons,
%exactly one electron and one muon, a substantial amount of missing transverse energy, \MET, 
%due to the presence of neutrinos in the final state, and either zero or one jet are selected. 
%This signature is common to other processes, which enter the analysis as backgrounds.
%The main background comes from WW production, irreducible background that shares the same final states and can only be separated by the use of certain kinematic properties.
%Another important background is W+jets, where a jet can mimic a leptonic signature.
%Background coming from top quark events, i.e. \ttbar and single top production, is also important, 
%followed by processes such as Drell-Yan, WZ, and other sub-dominant EW processes.
The analysis strategy follows the one used during Run 1 in the same channel, described in Chapter~\ref{chap4}, with some differences that are described in this chapter.

With respect to the centre-of-mass energy of 8\TeV, the ggH production cross section at 13\TeV is expected to increase of a factor of 2, thus raising the number of expected signal events. In addition, the cross section for the background processes is increases as well: the WW production cross section of a factor of 1.8 and the \ttbar cross section of a factor of 3.5.
