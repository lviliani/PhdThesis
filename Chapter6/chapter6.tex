\thispagestyle{empty}

In this chapter, a search for a high mass spin-0 particle (from now on denoted as X) in the $\mathrm{X\to WW \to e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\nu\bar{\nu}}$ decay channel is presented. 
The search is based upon the same proton-proton collision data samples considered in the previous chapter, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3\ifb  at $\sqrt{s} = 13$\TeV. This analysis represents a general extension of the SM Higgs boson measurement presented in Chapter~\ref{chap5} and is performed in a range of heavy scalar masses from $M_\mathrm{X} = 200$\GeV up to 1\TeV, extending the range studied in a similar analysis performed using Run 1 LHC data~\cite{Khachatryan:2015cwa}, which provided upper limits on the production cross section of new scalar resonances up to 600\GeV.

%Despite the discovery of a particle consistent with the SM Higgs boson in 2012, there is a possibility that this particle is only a part of a larger Higgs sector, and hence only partially responsible of the EW symmetry breaking. This can be achieved in different theoretical models that extends the SM, such as the two-Higgs-doublet models~\cite{Branco:2011iw,craig,Haber:2015}, or models in which the SM Higgs boson mixes with a heavy EW singlet, which predict the existence of an additional resonance at high mass, with couplings similar to those of the SM Higgs boson, as most recently described in~\cite{Chpoi:2013wga,Robens:2015gla}.

This analysis reports a generic search for a scalar particle assuming different decay width hypotheses, produced via the ggH and VBF production mechanisms. The results can then be interpreted in terms of different theoretical models, such as the ones discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:BSM}. This analysis is based on the SM Higgs boson measurement described in Chapter~\ref{chap5} in terms of physics objects, selections and background estimations. The differences are discussed in the following sections.
