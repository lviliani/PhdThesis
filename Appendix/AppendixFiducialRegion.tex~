\chapter{Fiducial region definition and optimization}

The generator level fiducial phase space definition must be chosen in order to closely match the selections applied in the analysis at the reconstructed level, in order to reduce the model dependence in the extrapolation step. This means that, for optimizing the fiducial phase space definition, the efficiency $\varepsilon_\mathrm{fid}$ (see~\ref{sec:fid_space}) has to be maximized. Another parameter playing an important role is the number of out-of-fiducial signal events (also called fakes), $f_\mathrm{out-of-fid}$, in other words the number of reconstructed events which do not belong to the fiducial phase space. This parameter should instead be as small as possible. A simplistic way to improve the fiducial phase space definition is to maximize the ratio between the overall efficiency and out-of-fiducial rate.

Several different fiducial region definitions were tested and the results show that:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf of cut:} The fiducial region definition must include only the opposite flavor combination including one electron and one muon. If we include also the combinations involving $\tau$'s the efficiency falls down.
\item {\bf Lepton cut:} Since the resolution on lepton transverse momentum is good, there is no need to loosen the cuts related these variables, i.e. we can use the same cuts defined in the analysis selection ($\pt^{\ell,1}>20$\GeV, $\pt^{\ell,2}>10$\GeV).
\item {\bf Di-lepton \pt cut:} As stated in the previous point, there is no need to loosen this cut, so we kept the same value as the analysis selection, i.e. $\ptll>30$\GeV.
\item {\bf Di-lepton mass cut:} $\mll>12$\GeV as discussed before.
\item {\bf neutrino pair \pt cut:} Since the resolution on the measurement of the missing transverse energy is poor, the neutrino pair cut should not be included in the definition of the fiducial region, because it would increase the fake rate without increasing the efficiency, thus resulting in a lower ratio between overall efficiency and fake rate.
\item {\bf \mt cut:} Also the \mt cut that we have in the analysis selection, i.e. $\mt>60$\GeV, should be loosened or removed because it involves neutrinos and then increase the fake rate. We decided eventually to keep this cut, loosening it to 50\GeV, because in addition to increase the number of fake events, it increases the efficiency as well.
\end{itemize}

The fake rate and the efficiency as a function of \pth after the optimization discussed before are shown in figure \ref{fig:eff_fake_comp}. To obtain these plots the fiducial region was modified adding in sequence the various cuts and computing the efficiency and the fake rate each time. In that way we can asses the composition of those distributions.

\end{figure}

The efficiency and fraction of fake events have been measured also as a function of the \MET and \mt cuts in the fiducial region. Since these two variables are correlated, the results are reported as two-dimensional histograms. In Fig.~\ref{fig:eff_fake_nom} are reported the efficiency and fraction of fake events for these two variables.

The criterion adopted to define the fiducial region is a tradeoff between having a large efficiency and a small fraction of fake events. Especially when looking at the low resolution variables, such as \MET and \mt, a suitable figure of merit has to be chosen for the estimation of the best cuts.  Several different figures of merit have been checked, such as $\epsilon/f$, $\epsilon - f$ and $(1-f)/\epsilon$. The results for these three different figures of merit are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fig_merit_nom} as a function of the \MET and \mt cuts in the fiducial region.

Following the same criterion, similar plots as above have been obtained for an alternative model, given by varying up the ggH/VBF ratio within the experimental uncertainties. The results, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eff_fake_up} and Fig.~\ref{fig:fig_merit_up}, show a similar trend with respect to the model with nominal ggH/VBF ratio.
