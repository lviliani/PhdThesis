This thesis work has been organized according to a twofold purpose, reporting firstly a precision measurement of the Higgs boson transverse momentum spectrum using proton-proton collision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\TeV and thereafter focusing on the first data collected by the CMS experiment at the unprecedented centre-of-mass energy of 13\TeV.

The transverse momentum spectrum and the inclusive cross section times branching fraction for the Higgs boson production have been reported using $\rm{H}\to\rm{W^+W^-}\to e^{\pm} \mu^{\mp}\nu\nu$ decays. Measurements have been performed using data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.4\ifb. The Higgs boson transverse momentum has been reconstructed using the lepton pair transverse momentum and missing transverse momentum. The differential cross section times branching fraction has been measured as a function of the Higgs boson transverse momentum in a fiducial phase space defined to match the experimental acceptance in terms of lepton kinematics and event topology. An unfolding procedure has been used to extrapolate the measured results to the fiducial phase space and to correct for the detector effects.
The measurements have been compared to SM theoretical estimations provided by the \textsc{HRed} and \textsc{Powheg V2} generators, showing good agreement within the experimental uncertainties. The inclusive cross section times branching fraction in the fiducial phase space has been measured to be $39\pm 8~(\mathrm{stat}) \pm 9~(\mathrm{syst})\,\mathrm{fb}$, consistent with the SM expectation.
