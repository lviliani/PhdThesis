\section{Unfolding}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:Unfolding}

To facilitate comparisons with theoretical predictions or other experimental results, the signal
extracted performing the fit has to be corrected for detector resolution and
efficiency effects and for the efficiency of the selection defined in the
analysis.
An unfolding procedure is used relying on the \textsc{RooUnfold} package
\cite{Adye:2011gm}, which provides the tools to run various unfolding
algorithms.

The basic principle behind the unfolding procedure in this analysis is to use MC signal samples
to make the ``true'' distribution of the variable of interest, which is obtained using simulated events before particle interaction with the detector, and the same distribution obtained
using events reconstructed after the full \textsc{Geant4} simulation of the CMS detector
and event reconstruction. These two distributions are used to calculate the detector
response matrix $M$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:resp_matrix}
R_{i}^{\rm {MC}} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} M_{ij}T_{j}^{\rm {MC}} \quad ,
\end{equation}

where $R^{\rm{MC}}$ and $T^{\rm{MC}}$ are two $n$-dimensional vectors
representing the distribution before and after event processing through CMS
simulation and reconstruction. The dimension $n$ of the two vectors corresponds 
to the number of bins in the distributions, equal to six in this analysis.
The response matrix $M$ includes all the effects related to the detector and analysis selection that affect the $R^{\rm{MC}}$ distribution.
The goal of the unfolding procedure is to obtain the $T^{\rm{truth}}$ distribution starting from the measured
$R^{\rm{observed}}$ distribution by inverting the matrix $M$.
To avoid the large variance and strong negative correlation between the neighbouring bins~\cite{Cowan:2002in}, the unfolding procedure in this analysis relies on the singular value decomposition~\cite{Hocker:1995kb} method based on the Tikhonov regularization
function.
Since the response matrix is in general limited by the statistical uncertainties of simulated samples and given the finite data statistical accuracy, a simple inversion could lead to large fluctuations between bins in the unfolded result. In particular, if the off-diagonal elements
of the response matrix are sizeable, the unfolded distribution has large variance and 
strong negative correlations between the neighbouring bins~\cite{Cowan:2002in}.
Several unfolding methods with regularization are available in literature, such as a method based on the Bayes' theorem, which overcome 
the unfolding instability using an iterative procedure~\cite{DAgostini:1994zf}.
One possible solution is the utilization of regularization methods.
Such methods introduce a regularization function that controls the smoothness of the distribution 
and depends generally on one regularization parameter, which can be controlled
to achieve the desired degree of smoothness.
The choice of the regularization parameter is particularly critical, and it
should represent an optimal trade-off between taming the fluctuations in the
unfolded result, and biasing the unfolded distribution towards the one used to
build the response matrix. 
The main feature of this method is the use of the singular value decomposition of the response matrix, including an additional term to suppress the oscillatory component of the solution, i.e. the regularization term, which represents some \textit{a priori} knowledge of the final solution.
The regularization parameter is chosen to obtain results that are robust against numerical instabilities and statistical fluctuations, following the prescription described in Ref.~\cite{Hocker:1995kb}.

The response matrix is built as a two-dimensional histogram, with the
generator-level \pth{} on the $y$ axis and the same variable after the reconstruction on the $x$ axis, using the same binning for both distributions.
The resulting detector response matrix, including all signal sources and normalized by row, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:matrix}(a).
The value of the diagonal bins corresponds to the stability S. The same matrix, normalized by column, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:matrix}(b). In this case the diagonal bins correspond to the purity P. The $S$ and $P$ parameters, defined in Sec.~\ref{sec:AnalysisStrategy}, provide an estimate of the \pth resolution and migration effects.
The main source of bin migrations effects in the response matrix is the limited resolution in the measurement of \MET.

The resulting detector response matrix, which includes the effects of all signal sources and is represented by normalizing each row to unity is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:matrix}(a). This representation shows the stability $S$ in the diagonal bins, where $S$ is defined as the ratio of the number of events generated and reconstructed in a given bin, and the number of events generated in that bin. In addition, a deconvolution matrix is constructed by normalizing each column to unity and is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:matrix}(b). This latter representation shows the purity $P$ in the diagonal bins, where $P$ is defined as the ratio of the number of events generated and reconstructed in a given bin, and the number of events reconstructed in that bin. The $S$ and $P$ parameters provide an estimate of the \pth{} resolution and of migration effects.
The response matrix built including all signal sources is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:matrix}. In order to point out either the purity or the stability in diagonal bins, each column or row of the matrix was respectively normalized to unity. The matrix obtained in the first case is what is actually called detector response matrix, while in the other case the matrix is usually referred to as detector deconvolution matrix.

\end{figure}

Several closure tests are performed in order to validate the unfolding
procedure. To estimate the uncertainty in the unfolding procedure due to the
particular model adopted for building the response matrix, two independent
gluon fusion samples are used, corresponding to two different generators:
\textsc{Powheg V1} and \textsc{JHUGen} generators, both interfaced to \textsc{Pythia 6.4}.
The \textsc{JHUGen} generator sample is used to build the response matrix while the
\textsc{Powheg V1} sample is used for the measured and the MC distributions at
generator level. The result of this test shows good agreement between the unfolded and the distribution from MC simulation.

In order to further prove the choice of the regularization parameter, a large number of simulated pseudo-experiments has been generated to verify that the coverage of the unfolded uncertainties obtained with this procedure is as expected.
From each pseudo-experiment the reconstructed \pth spectrum is obtained and then unfolded using the procedure described above, including only the statistical uncertainties. The coverage is calculated for each \pth bin, counting the number of pseudo-experiments for which the statistical uncertainty covers the true value. The confidence intervals are calculated using the Clopper-Pearson approach, and the results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:coverage} for different values of the regularization parameter: starting from $k_\mathrm{reg}=2$ (stronger regularization) up to $k_\mathrm{reg}=
5$ (weaker regularization). The criterion for choosing the best $k_\mathrm{reg}$ value is to increase the regularization as much as possible without introducing a bias, i.e. until a 68\% coverage is fulfilled. This criterion leads to the same result as the prescription described in Ref.~\cite{Hocker:1995kb}, strengthening the choice of $k_\mathrm{reg}=3$.

\subsection{Treatment of systematic uncertainties}

An important aspect of this analysis is the treatment of the systematic
uncertainties and the error propagation through the unfolding procedure.
The sources of uncertainty are divided into three categories, depending
on whether the uncertainty affects only the signal yield (type A), both the signal
yield and the response matrix (type B), or only the response matrix (type C).
These three classes propagate differently through the unfolding procedure.

Type A uncertainties are extracted directly from the fit in the form of a covariance
matrix, which is passed to the unfolding tool as the covariance
matrix of the measured distribution. The nuisance parameters belonging to this category
are the background shape and normalization uncertainties.
To extract the effect of type A uncertainties a dedicated fit is performed,
fixing to constant all the nuisance parameters in the model, but type A nuisance parameters.
The correlation matrix among the six signal strengths corresponding to the six \pth bins, including all type A uncertainties, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:typeA_corr}.
The correlation cor($i$,$j$) of bins $i$ and $j$ is defined as:	

\begin{equation}\label{eq:correlation}
\mathrm{cor}(i,j) = \frac{ \mathrm{cov}(i,j) }{  s_{i}s_{j} } \qquad ,
\end{equation} 

where $\mathrm{cov}(i,j)$ is the covariance of bins $i$ and $j$, and ($s_{i}$,
$s_{j}$) are the standard deviations of bins $i$ and $j$,  respectively.

\caption{Correlations among the signal strengths corresponding to the six \pth bins including all type A uncertainties.}\label{fig:typeA_corr}
\end{figure}

The nuisance parameters falling in the type B class are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the b veto scale factor. It affects the signal and background templates
by varying the number of events with jets that enter the selection. It also
affects the response matrix because the reconstructed spectrum is harder or softer depending on the number of jets, which in turn depends on the veto. 
\item the lepton efficiency scale factor. It affects the signal and background
template shape and normalization. It affects the response matrix by varying
the reconstructed spectrum;
\item the \MET scale and resolution, which have an effect similar to the above;
\item lepton scale and resolution. The effect is similar to the above;
\item jet energy scale. It affects the signal and background template shape
and normalization. It also affects the response matrix because, by varying the
fraction of events with jets, the b veto can reject more or fewer events, thus
making the reconstructed spectrum harder or softer.
\end{itemize}
The effect of each type B uncertainty is evaluated separately,
since each one changes the response matrix in a different way.
In order to evaluate their effect on the signal strengths parameters, two additional fits are
performed, each time fixing  the nuisance parameter value to $\pm 1$  standard
deviation with respect
to its nominal value. The results of the fits are then compared to the results of the full fit obtained by floating  all the nuisance parameters, thus 
determining the relative uncertainty on the signal strengths due to each
nuisance parameter, as shown in Tab.~\ref{table:corr_syst}.
Using these uncertainties, the measured spectra for each type B
source are built.
The effects are propagated through the unfolding by building the corresponding variations of the response matrix and unfolding the
measured spectra with the appropriate matrix.

Type C uncertainties are related to the underlying assumption on the Higgs boson production mechanism used to extract the fiducial cross sections. These are evaluated using alternative response matrices that are obtained by varying the relative fraction of the VBF and ggH components within the experimental uncertainty, as given by the CMS combined measurement~\cite{Khachatryan:2014jba}.
Three different response matrices are built, corresponding to the nominal, scaled up, and scaled down
VBF/ggH ratio. The nominal matrix assumes the SM VBF/ggH ratio, %with $\mu_{\mathrm{ggH}} = \mu_{\mathrm{VBF}} = 1$, 
while up- and down-scaled matrices are constructed by varying the SM signal strengths within the
experimental constraints for VBF and ggH in such a way as to obtain the
maximal variation of the VBF/ggH ratio allowed by the experimental
constraints.
%The VBF/ggH fractions are varied in an anticorrelated way in order to produce the maximum variation of the spectrum shape allowed by the experimental constraints.
These three matrices are used to unfold the reconstructed spectrum with the nominal VBF/ggH fraction, and obtain an uncertainty on the unfolded spectrum.
%It was verified that the variations of the measured spectrum do not affect the shape of the signal templates, \textit{i.e.} \mll~and \mth.

%Type A and B uncertainties are finally combined together after the unfolding
%summing in quadrature positive and negative contributions separately for each bin. Type C uncertainties, also referred to as ``model dependence'', are instead quoted separately.
%The effect of each source of the uncertainty is quoted for each bin of \pth~in Table~\ref{table:values_and_uncertainties}.
