\label{sec:Datasets}

This analysis relies on the published \hww measurements~\cite{Chatrchyan:2013iaa} in terms of code, selections and background estimates for both the ggH and VBF prodocution mechanisms.

\subsection{Data sets and triggers\label{subsec:Datasets}}

The data sets used for the analysis correspond to 19.4\ifb at $\sqrt{s}=8$\TeV  of integrated luminosity composed of the following CMS data taking periods during 2012: 2012A (892~$\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$), 2012B (4440~$\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$), and 2012C (6898~$\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$) and 2012D (7238~$\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$).
Data have been checked and validated and only data corresponding to good data taking quality are considered.
The $\mathrm{e}^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}$ final state is considered in this analysis.

For the data samples, the events are required to fire one of the unprescaled
single-electron, single-muon or muon-electron triggers. Due the rather high LHC instantaneous luminosity the single-lepton triggers must have high HLT \pt thresholds, otherwise the rate of these triggers would be too large to be sustained. The double-lepton triggers allow to lower down the \pt thresholds while keeping a sustainable trigger rate, thus maintaining a good sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal, for which the lepton \pt can be rather small.
A brief overview of the HLT \pt criteria on the leptons
is given in Table~\ref{tab:trigger}. While the HLT lepton \pt thresholds of 17 and 8 \GeV for the double
lepton triggers accommodate the offline lepton \pt selection of 20 and 10 \GeV, the higher \pt thresholds
in the single lepton triggers help partially recovering double lepton trigger inefficiencies
as a high \pt lepton is on average expected due to the kinematic of the Higgs decay.

Muon-Electron      & $\pt > 17$ and $8 $ \GeV         \\ 
Electron-Muon      & $\pt > 17$ and $8 $ \GeV         \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:trigger}

\end{table}

The trigger is not simulated in MC samples but the combined trigger efficiency
is estimated from data and applied as a weight to all simulated events. The trigger efficiency for single and double lepton triggers is calculated using a Tag and Probe technique separately for muons and electrons, in bins of $\eta$ and \pt.
The Tag and Probe method uses a known mass resonance (e.g. $J/\Psi$, Z) to select particles of the desired type, and probe the efficiency of a particular selection criterion on these particles. In general the ``tag'' is an object that passes a set of very
tight selection criteria designed to isolate the required particle type. Tags are often referred
to as a “golden” electrons or muons and the fake rate for passing tag selection criteria should
be very small. A generic set of the desired particle type (i.e. with potentially very loose selection criteria) known as ``probes'' is selected by pairing these objects with tags such that the
invariant mass of the combination is consistent with the mass of the resonance. Combinatoric
backgrounds may be eliminated through any of a variety of background subtraction methods
such as fitting, or sideband subtraction. The definition of the probe objects depend on the
specifics of the selection criterion being examined. The simple expression to get the efficiency $\epsilon$
as a function of \pt and $\eta$ is given below:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon(\pt,\eta) = \frac{ N^\mathrm{probe}_\mathrm{pass}}{N^\mathrm{probe}_\mathrm{pass} + N^\mathrm{probe}_\mathrm{fail}}
\end{equation}

For double lepton triggers the efficiency is calculated separately for each leg of the trigger and then combined together. The combined efficiency is then used as a kinematics-dependent weight to be applied on top of simulated events.

The event efficiency $\epsilon_\mathrm{ev}$ for an event with two leptons to pass the single lepton trigger is given by the following formula:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:single_trigg}
\epsilon_\mathrm{ev} = 1 - (1-\epsilon_{S,\ell1})\cdot(1-\epsilon_{S,\ell2})\quad,
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_{S,\ell1}$ and $\epsilon_{S,\ell2}$ are the efficiencies for the leading and subleading lepton to pass the single lepton trigger. In other words, the dilepton event passes the single lepton trigger if either one of the two leptons passes the single lepton trigger, excluding the cases for which both leptons pass the trigger. For double lepton triggers, the event efficiency can be written as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:double_trigg}
\epsilon_\mathrm{ev}  = \epsilon_{D,\ell1}^\mathrm{lead} \cdot \epsilon_{D,\ell2}^\mathrm{trail} + (  1 -  \epsilon_{D,\ell1}^\mathrm{lead} \cdot \epsilon_{D,\ell2}^\mathrm{trail})\cdot\epsilon_{D,\ell1}^\mathrm{trail} \cdot \epsilon_{D,\ell2}^\mathrm{lead} \quad,
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_{D,\ell1}^{\mathrm{lead}(trail)}$ is the efficiency of the first lepton to pass the leading (trailing) leg of the double lepton trigger, and $\epsilon_{D,\ell2}^{\mathrm{lead}(trail)}$ is the efficiency of the second lepton to pass the leading (trailing) leg of the double lepton trigger. The final event efficiency applied to reweight the events in simulation is given by the boolean OR of the event efficiencies corresponding to the single and double lepton triggers, which, using Eqs.~\eqref{eq:single_trigg} and ~\eqref{eq:double_trigg}, can be written as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\epsilon_\mathrm{ev} & = 1 - (1-\epsilon_{S,\ell1})\cdot(1-\epsilon_{S,\ell2}) + \\
                     & + (1-\epsilon_{S,\ell1})\cdot(1-\epsilon_{S,\ell2}) \cdot \\
                     & \cdot [ \epsilon_{D,\ell1}^\mathrm{lead} \cdot \epsilon_{D,\ell2}^\mathrm{trail} + (  1 -  \epsilon_{D,\ell1}^\mathrm{lead} \cdot \epsilon_{D,\ell2}^\mathrm{trail})\cdot\epsilon_{D,\ell1}^\mathrm{trail} \cdot \epsilon_{D,\ell2}^\mathrm{lead} ] \quad.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The term that multiplies the double lepton trigger event efficiency is needed to ensure that the events passing the double lepton trigger do not pass also the single lepton trigger.

\subsection{Monte-Carlo samples\label{subsec:MC}}

Several Monte Carlo event generators are used to simulate the signal and background processes:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first version of the \textsc{Powheg} program~\cite{Kramer:2005hw,Frixione:2007vw,Lavesson:2008ah,Alioli:2008tz, Nason:2009ai} (\textsc{Powheg V1}) provides event samples for the \hww signal
for the gluon fusion (ggH) and VBF production mechanisms, as well as \ttbar and tW processes~\cite{Alioli:2011as}, with NLO accuracy.
\item The $\mathrm{qq} \to \mathrm{W^{+}W^{-}}$, Drell-Yan, ZZ, WZ, W$\gamma$, W$\gamma^*$, tri-bosons and W+jets processes are generated using
the \textsc{Madgraph 5.1.3}~\cite{Alwall:2014hca} event generator.
\item The gg$\to \mathrm{W^{+}W^{-}}$ process is generated using the \textsc{gg2ww} 3.1 generator ~\cite{Binoth:2006mf} and its cross section is scaled to the approximate NLO prediction~\cite{Bonvini:2013jha,Passarino:2013bha}.
\item The VH process is simulated using \textsc{pythia 6.426}~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za}.
\end{itemize}
For leading-order generators samples, the \textsc{cteq6l}~\cite{Lai:2010nw} set of parton distribution functions
(PDF) is used, while \textsc{ct10}~\cite{Lai:2010vv} is used for next-to-leading order (NLO) ones.
Cross section calculations~\cite{Dittmaier:2011ti} at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) are used for the \hww process, while NLO calculations are used for background cross sections.
The $\hww$ process simulation is reweighted so that the \pth{} spectrum and inclusive production cross section closely match the SM calculations that have NNLO+NNLL pQCD accuracy in the description of the Higgs boson inclusive production, in accordance with the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group recommendations~\cite{Heinemeyer:2013tqa}.
The reweighting of the \pth{} spectrum is achieved by tuning the \textsc{Powheg} generator, as described in detail in Ref.~\cite{Alioli:2010xd}.
Cross sections computed with NLO pQCD accuracy~\cite{Heinemeyer:2013tqa} are used for the background processes.
The contribution of the \ttH production mechanisms is checked to be negligible in each bin of \pth (below 1\%) and is not included among the different production mechanisms. In Fig.~\ref{fig:signal_comp} the relative fraction of the four production mechanisms is shown for each \pth bin.

\begin{figure}[htb]

\caption{Relatve fraction of ggH, VBF, VH and ttH in each bin of the Higgs boson transverse momentum.}\label{fig:signal_comp}
\end{figure}


For all processes, the detector response is simulated using a detailed description of the CMS detector, based on the \textsc{Geant4} package~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}.

Minimum bias events are superimposed on the simulated events to emulate the additional 
pp interactions per bunch crossing (pileup). The number of pile-up events simulated in the MC samples
(in the same bunch crossing, in time, or in the previous or following one, out of time pileup)
have been generated poissonianly sampling from a distribution similar to what
is expected from data. For a given range of analyzed runs, the mean number of pileup interactions per bunch crossing is estimated per luminosity block using the instantaneous luminosity provided by the LHC, integrated over the entire run range and normalized.
The average number of pileup events per beam crossing in the 2011 data is about 10, and in the 2012 data it is about 20.

The simulated events are reweighted to correct for observed differences between data and simulation in the number of pileup events, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nvertices}, trigger efficiency, and lepton reconstruction and identification efficiencies~\cite{Chatrchyan:2013iaa}.

\begin{figure}[htb]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/nvertex.pdf}
\caption{Distribution of the number of vertices in data and in simulation, before and after applying the pile-up reweighting.}\label{fig:nvertices}
\end{figure}

For the comparison of the measured unfolded spectrum with the theoretical predictions, two additional MC generators are used for simulating the SM Higgs boson production in the ggH process: \textsc{HRes} 2.3~\cite{deFlorian:2012mx,Grazzini:2013mca} and the second version of the \textsc{Powheg} generator (\textsc{Powheg V2})~\cite{Bagnaschi:2011tu}.
\textsc{HRes} is a partonic level MC generator that computes the SM Higgs
boson cross section at NNLO accuracy in pQCD and performs the NNLL
resummation of soft-gluon effects at small \pt. The central predictions of
\textsc{HRes} are obtained including the exact top and bottom quark mass contribution to
the gluon fusion loop, fixing the renormalization and factorization scale central values at a Higgs boson mass of 125\GeV. The cross section normalization is scaled, to take into account electroweak corrections, by a factor of 1.05 and the effects of threshold resummation by a factor of 1.06~\cite{Actis:2008ug,Catani:2003zt}. The upper and lower bounds of the uncertainties are obtained by scaling up and down both the renormalization and the factorization scales by a factor of two.
The \textsc{Powheg V2} generator is a matrix element based generator that provides a NLO description of the ggH process in association with zero jets, taking into account the finite mass of the bottom and top quarks.
The \textsc{Powheg} prediction is tuned using the \textsc{Powheg} damping factor \textit{hdump} of 104.17~\GeV, in order to match the \pth{} spectrum predicted by \textsc{HRes} in the full phase space. This factor reduces the emission of additional jets in the high \pt regime, and enhances the contribution from the Sudakov form factor in the limit of low \pt.
The \textsc{Powheg} generator is interfaced to the \textsc{JHUGen} generator version 5.2.5~\cite{Gao:2010qx,Bolognesi:2012mm,Anderson:2013afp} for the decay of the Higgs boson to a W boson pair and interfaced with \textsc{Pythia 8}~\cite{Sjostrand:2007gs} for the simulation of parton shower and hadronization effects.
