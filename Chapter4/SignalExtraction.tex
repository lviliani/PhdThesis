\label{sec:SignalExtraction}

According to the ``blinding'' policy of the CMS Collaboration, the strategy of the analysis has been scrutinized and approved by a selected committee of internal reviewers before looking at the data in the signal region. This approach prevents the analysts from being biased by the data in the developing phase of the analysis. Below are shown the results after having looked at the data.


\subsection{Fitting procedure}\label{sec:fit}

The signal, including ggH, VBF, and VH production mechanisms, is extracted in each bin of \pth{} by performing a binned maximum likelihood fit simultaneously in all \pth{} bins to a two-dimensional template for signals and backgrounds in the \mll--\mt{} plane.
The variables used for the two-dimensional template are chosen for their power to discriminate signal and background contributions. This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2Dlegacy}, where the two-dimensional MC distributions are shown for the signal and background processes in the 0-jets category. 

\begin{figure}[htb]

\caption{Two-dimensional \mll--\mt distribution for signal (a) and background (b) processes in the 0-jets category.\label{fig:2Dlegacy}}
\end{figure}

Six different signal strength parameters are extracted from the fit, one for each \pth~bin. The relative contributions of the different Higgs production mechanisms in the signal template are taken to be the same as in the SM. The systematic uncertainty sources are considered as nuisance parameters in the fit.

The binning of the \mll and \mt templates is chosen to be:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\mll: $[12,30,45,60,75,100,125,150,175,200]$} 
\item {\mt: $[60,70,80,90,100,110,120,140,160,180,200,220,240,280]$}
\end{itemize}

To avoid a dependence of the results on the variables used for the template fit, \mll and \mt need to be uncorrelated with respect to \pth.
This as been verified and the correlation between the discriminating variables and \pth is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:correlation_ggH} and Fig.~\ref{fig:correlation_vbf} for ggH and VBF production modes respectively.

\end{figure}

The relative contribution for different production mechanisms in the input signal template is taken to be the same as the SM.
The signal strength $\mu$ in each bin, i.e. the ratio between the measured cross section and the SM one, $\mu = \sigma/\sigma_\mathrm{SM}$, is allowed to float between -10 and +10, thus allowing negative values. This is mainly intended to allow the error bars to float below 0.

Because of detector resolution effects, some of the reconstructed $\hww$ signal events might originate from outside the fiducial phase space.  
These out-of-fiducial signal events cannot be precisely handled by the unfolding procedure and must be subtracted from the measured spectrum. The \pth~distribution of the out-of-fiducial signal events is taken from simulation, and each bin is multiplied by the corresponding measured signal strength before performing the subtraction. 

At the end, the number of events in each bin $i$ of the measured spectrum is:
\begin{equation}
N_i = \mu_i (s_i -f_i) \quad ,
\end{equation}
where $s_i$ and $f_i$ are respectively the number of signal and fake events expected from simulation and $\mu_i$ is the measured signal strength.

The fit makes use of the binned maximum likelihood approach.The likelihood function, $\mathcal{L}$, restricted to the \pth bin $j$, can be written as: \textcolor{red}{CHECK!!}

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(data | \mu_j,\theta) = \prod_{i=0}^{N_\mathrm{bins}} \frac{(\mu_j s_i(\theta) + b_i(\theta))^{n_i}}{n_i!}e^{-\mu_j s_i(\theta) - b_i(\theta)} \cdot p(\tilde{\theta} | \theta) \quad ,
\end{equation}

where \emph{data} corresponds to the experimental observation and $\mu_j$ is the signal strength in the bin $j$, i.e. the parameter of interest of the fit, which multiplies the signal yield. The index $i$ runs over the bins of the \mll-\mt two-dimensional histogram corresponding the \pth bin $j$, $s_i$ and $b_i$ are the expected number of signal and background events respectively in bin $i$, and $n_i$ is the total number of observed events in bin $i$. The set of parameters $\theta$ represents the full suite of nuisance parameters used to incorporate the systematic uncertainties. Each nuisance parameter is constrained in the fit including the prior distributions functions $p(\tilde{\theta} | \theta)$ in the likelihood, where $\tilde{\theta}$ is the set of default values for the $\theta$ parameters. For the major part of the nuisance parameters a log-normal prior distribution is used, with a standard deviation corresponding to the given systematic uncertainty. For some nuisance parameters, as the ones related to the statistical uncertainty coming from the background measurement in data control regions, a Gamma distribution is instead recommended. A log-uniform distribution is used for the uncertainty related to the normalization of background contributions that are left unconstrained in the fit, such as the WW background process.
Finally, some of the experimental uncertainties, related to the shape of signal and background processes, are modelled by means of additional histograms as explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:syst_treatment}. The nuisance parameters correlations across different \pth bins are taken into account. Moreover the nuisance parameters can also be correlated (or anti-correlated) between signal and different background processes. As an example, the uncertainty related to the integrated luminosity measurement is fully correlated for all the signal and background processes.

Before running the fit on the data, the same procedure has been applied to the so called \textit{Asimov data set}\footnote{In a parallel reality imagined by the science fiction writer I. Asimov, politics was run in a peculiar way: instead of mobilizing millions of people to cast their vote to deliberate on something, an algorithm was used to select an individual ``average'' person, and then this person was asked to take the decision on that matter.}, which provides a simple method to estimate the signal sensitivity before looking at the data~\cite{Cowan:2010js}.


\subsection{Signal and background yields}\label{subsec:yields}


A comparison of data and background prediction is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:mllSignalRegion}, where the \mll{} distribution is shown for the six \pth{} bins. Distributions correspond to the \mt{} window of [60, 110]\GeV, in order to emphasize the signal contribution~\cite{Chatrchyan:2013iaa}. The \mt distributions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mTSignalRegion} and correspond to the \mll window of [12, 75]\GeV.

%The signal yield after the fit with data is found to be of $318 \pm 12$ events, to be compared with the expected value of $382 \pm 7$ events.
The spectrum shown in Fig. \ref{fig:pre_unfolding} is obtained after having performed the fit and after the subtraction of the out-of-fiducial signal events, but before undergoing the unfolding procedure. The theoretical distribution after the detector simulation and event reconstruction is also shown for comparison.

Data values after the background subtraction are shown together with the statistical and the systematic uncertainties, determined propagating the sources of uncertainty through the fit procedure. The line and dashed area represent the SM theoretical estimates in which the acceptance of the dominant ggH contribution is modelled by \textsc{Powheg V1}. The sub-dominant component of the signal is denoted as XH=VBF+VH, and is shown with the cross filled area separately.}\label{fig:pre_unfolding}
\end{figure}

In order to assess the robustness of the fit, several toy MC samples have been produced, with a statistical accuracy corresponding to the one expected in data. The distribution of the signal strengths extracted in each bin using the toy MC samples and the their pull distributions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pull_fit}. 
\begin{figure}[htb]

\end{figure}

%As expected the Top background becomes more important while going to high values of \pth, accordingly to the higher jet multiplicity in that region. The discrepancy between MC prediction and data, especially for low values of Higgs \pt, is due WW background which in this plots is fixed to the MC cross section.
