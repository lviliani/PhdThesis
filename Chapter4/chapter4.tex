Measurements of the fiducial cross sections and of several differential
distributions, using the $\sqrt{s}=8$\TeV LHC data, have been reported by ATLAS~\cite{Aad:2014tca,Aad:2014lwa,Aad:2015lha} and CMS~\cite{Khachatryan:2015rxa,Khachatryan:2015yvw} for the ${\mathrm{H} \to \mathrm{ZZ} \to 4\ell}$ ($\ell = \mathrm{e},\mu$) and H $\to \gamma\gamma$ decay channels. In this chapter a measurement of the fiducial cross section times branching fraction ($\sigma \times \mathcal{B}$) and \pt{} spectrum for Higgs boson production in \ensuremath{\mathrm{H}\rightarrow{}\WW\rightarrow \mathrm{e}^{\pm} \mu^{\mp}\nu\nu} ~decays, based on $\sqrt{s} = 8$\TeV LHC data, is reported.

The analysis is performed looking at different flavour leptons in the final state in order to suppress the sizeable contribution of backgrounds containing a same-flavour lepton pair originating from Z boson decay.

Although the \hwwllnn{} channel has lower resolution in the \pth{} measurement
compared to the H $\to \gamma\gamma$ and  H $\to \rm{ZZ}\to 4\ell$ channels
because of neutrinos in the final state, the channel has a significantly
larger $\sigma \times \mathcal{B}$, exceeding those for H $\to \gamma\gamma$ by a factor
of 10 and H $\to \rm{ZZ}\to 4\ell$ by a factor of 85 for a Higgs boson mass of
125\GeV~\cite{Heinemeyer:2013tqa}, and is characterized by good signal
sensitivity. Such sensitivity allowed the observation of a Higgs boson at the level of 4.3 (5.8 expected)
standard deviations for a mass hypothesis of 125.6 GeV using the full LHC data set at 7 and 8\TeV~\cite{Chatrchyan:2013iaa}.

The measurement is performed in a fiducial phase space defined by kinematic requirements on
the leptons that closely match the experimental event selection.

The effect of the limited detector resolution, as well as the
selection efficiency with respect to the fiducial phase space are corrected to
particle level with an unfolding procedure~\cite{Cowan:2002in}, as explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:Unfolding}.
