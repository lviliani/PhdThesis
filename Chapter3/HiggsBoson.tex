\section{Higgs boson measurements at LHC}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:HiggsBosonLHC}

The discovery of a new boson consistent with the standard model (SM) Higgs boson has
been reported by ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in 2012. The discovery has been followed
by a comprehensive set of studies of properties of this new boson in several production and
decay channels and no evidence of deviation from the SM expectation has been found so
far. The CMS studies in the \hwwllnn decay channel include the measurement
of the Higgs properties, as well as constraints on the Higgs total decay width and gauge
bosons anomalous couplings.
