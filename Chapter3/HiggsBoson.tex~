\label{sec:HiggsBosonLHC}

The discovery of a new boson consistent with the standard model (SM) Higgs boson has
been reported by ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in 2012. The discovery has been followed
by a comprehensive set of studies of properties of this new boson in several production and
decay channels and no evidence of deviation from the SM expectation has been found so
far.
