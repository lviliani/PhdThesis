\label{sec:PF}

The Particle Flow (PF) event reconstruction technique~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001} aims at the reconstruction and identification of all the stable particles in the event, i.e. electrons, muons, photons, charged and neutral hadrons, with a thorough combination of the information from all CMS subdetectors, in order to determine their energy, direction and type. These individual particles are then used, for example, to build jets, to measure the missing transverse energy \MET, to reconstruct the $\tau$ from their decay products, to quantify the charged lepton isolation and to tag b-jets.

The CMS detector is well suited for this purpose. Indeed, the presence of a large internal silicon tracker immersed in an intense solenoidal magnetic field allows the reconstruction of charged particles with high efficiency and small fake rate, providing a high precision measurement of the particle \pt down to about $150\,\MeV$, for $|\eta|\leq2.5$. The high granularity of ECAL is the additional key element for the feasibility of the PF technique, allowing the reconstruction of photons and electrons with high energy resolution in a dense environment.

The first step of the PF technique consists in the reconstruction of the basic elements from the various subdetectors, such as charged-particle tracks, calorimeter clusters and muon tracks. These elements, which are provided by the subdetectors with high efficiency an low fake rate, are then connected together with a link algorithm.

The good performance of the tracking system has a key role in the PF technique and is achieved by means of an iterative tracking strategy~\cite{Chatrchyan:2014fea}, based on the Kalman Filter algorithm~\cite{Billoir:1990we} and described in detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:tracking}.

The high detection efficiency of the calorimeters is based on a specific calorimeter clustering algorithm, which is performed separately in each subdetector. The algorithm is based on three steps: in the first step ``cluster seeds'' are identified as local calorimeter cells with an energy deposit above a given threshold. Then ``topological clusters'' are grown from the seeds by gathering cells with at least one side in common with a cell already in the cluster, and with an energy above a given threshold. A topological cluster usually gives rise to as many ``particle flow clusters'' as its seeds. Thus the energy of each cell is shared among the particle flow clusters according to the cell-cluster distance.

These elements are then connected to each other using a link algorithm, which identifies blocks of elements that are topologically compatible. For example, a charged-particle track is linked to a calorimeter particle flow cluster if the extrapolated position from the track to the calorimeter is compatible with the cluster boundaries. From these blocks, PF candidates are identified in the following order:
\begin{itemize}
\item Muons: muons are reconstructed as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:muID}. A \emph{global muon} gives rise to a \emph{PF muon} if its combined \pt measurement is compatible within 3 standard deviations with the one provided by the sole tracker. The corresponding track is removed from the block;
\item Electrons: a detailed description of electron reconstruction is given in Sec.~\ref{sec:eleIdIso}. Electrons tend to give rise to short tracks, and to lose energy by \emph{bremsstrahlung} in the tracker layers on their way to the calorimeter. The link between a charged-particle track (refitted with the Gaussian-Sum Filter (GSF)~\cite{Adam:815410}) and one or more ECAL clusters identifies a \emph{PF electron}. After the identification, the corresponding tracks and clusters are removed from the block;
\item Charged hadrons: the remaining tracks give rise to \emph{PF charged hadrons}. Tracks can be linked to ECAL and HCAL clusters, and the energy is determined taking into account information from calorimeters;
\item Photons and neutral hadrons: ECAL clusters not linked with tracks give rise to \emph{PF photons}, while the remaining HCAL clusters are identified as \emph{PF neutral hadrons}.
\end{itemize}
After the identification of all PF candidates in the event, \emph{PF jets} are clustered as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:jets}. The last step is the reconstruction of the missing transverse momentum \emph{PF \ptmiss}, which is described in Sec.~\ref{sec:met}.
% The missing transverse energy, \MET, is defined as the modulus of \ptmiss.
