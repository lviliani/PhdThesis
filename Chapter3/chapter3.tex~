\chapter{Reconstruction and identification of physics objetcs}\label{chap3}
\thispagestyle{empty}

In CMS, the physics object reconstruction and identification is based on standard algorithms developed by the collaboration and used by all the physics analyses. In this section, the techniques used for the reconstruction and identification of the physics objects of interest for \hwwllnn analyses are described.
