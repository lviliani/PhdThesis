\section{The \hww decay channel}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:HWWchannel}

The CMS studies in the \hwwllnn decay channel include the measurement
of the Higgs properties, as well as constraints on the Higgs total decay width and gauge
bosons anomalous couplings.
