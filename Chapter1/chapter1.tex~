\chapter{Physics at the LHC}\label{chap1}
\thispagestyle{empty}

In this chapter the Standard Model of particle physics is briefly described, in particular the main characteristics of the electroweak and strong interactions are discussed, as well as the machanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking.
In addition, the phenomenology of the proton-proton interactions is described and the main features of the Monte Carlo simulation techniques are given.
Eventually, an overview of the Higgs boson physics from an experimental point of view is reported.
