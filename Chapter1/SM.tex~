\label{sec:SM}

The Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM) is the theory that describes all fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions. It is a quantum field theory based on a $\mathrm{SU(3)_c \otimes SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y}$ local gauge symmetry, and is capable to provide a quantitative description of three of the four interactions in nature: electromagnetism, weak interaction and strong nuclear force.
During the past decades the predictions of the SM have been confirmed by experimental results with outstanding precision.
